	<h3>Our mission is to provide the public with a valuable tool that could be 
used to connect with a cultural organization offering specific services
such as food, decor, clothing, etc. If you’re looking to “get in touch with
your roots” Localito is the place to go.

Our listings are comprised of hole-in-the-wall local shops that are family
owned. We work together to bring you closer to understanding the world 
around you and its diverse offerings.

We are a community-based platform and rely on user inputted data to 
help update our listings. Whether you’re ice fishing in the farthest corner
of Alaska or sunbathing on the humid beaches of Florida you’re always 
close when home calls.  </h3>
